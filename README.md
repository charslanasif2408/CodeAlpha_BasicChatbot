# CodeAlpha_BasicChatbot
TASK 4: Basic Chatbot
Objective:
Build a rule-based chatbot that responds to simple user inputs.
Key Concepts Used:
functions for response logic
if-elif conditions
loops for continuous interaction
input/output for user messages
How It Works:
The bot checks the user's message for specific keywords (e.g., "hello", "how are you").
It responds with predefined answers.
The loop continues until the user says "bye".
Sample Chat:
You: helloðŸ¤– Chatbot: Hi!You: how are youðŸ¤– Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks!You: byeðŸ¤– Chatbot: Goodbye!
